# ATIT2-22

The assignments are designed so no specific hardware (like GPU support) is required.


## Working on your assignments

For the assignment you have several options:

1) You can use Google Colaboratory (Colab) to work on your assignments. (encouraged, since no installation is required)
https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb
You can open the assignment by selecting "File", "Open Notebook", select the "GitHub" tab and then enter the link of this git repository: https://github.com/schneiderson/ATIT2-22/

2) You can use Jupyter Notebooks to work on your assignments.
You will need to install Jupyter locally if you choose not to use Colab. 
I recommend installing Anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and then use Anaconda to install Jupyter Notebooks (https://jupyter.org/install).
Either download the repository as a Zip archive using the web interface as shown in the image below.

Open the downloaded files in Jupyter.

3) Install python and the required packages locally. (If you have previous experience with python development, otherwise discouraged) 


## Additional learning resources
1) Find the notebooks discussed in class in the intro directory.
2) Python: If you are new to python and want to get an introduction, I recommend this Kaggle course: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python



## Handing in your assignments
1) For both Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook: please export your Notebook (as .ipynb file) using the menu.

2) If you are developing in python locally, please create a zip archive of your script.
